`Phenyl` provides an out-of-the-box bridge between chat apps and Minecraft.

Currently works for [Bungeecord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord)(and its compatible forks, e.g. [Waterfall](https://github.com/PaperMC/Waterfall)) and [Tencent QQ](https://im.qq.com/index).

## Setup

## Build

```bash
